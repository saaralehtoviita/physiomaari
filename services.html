                                as well as rehab after a surgery for ACL-injuries and meniscal injuries. I also have a lot of experience in

                                for any kinds of injuries or pain associated with CrossFit or weightlifting. My focus is in active physiotherapy and exercise.
                                I also work with anyone who wishes to train to improve their health, or improve their performance in sports.
