                                    The main workout includes 3-4 pieces, that are either weightlifting, strength, skill, gymnastics, movement quality or endurance. 
                                    The optional piece can be any one of these as well, or an accessory-piece.

                                    <strong>MYPOWERFIX Longevity</strong> is one of our main focuses in the program. This is taken into account in the programming when planning 
                                    the specific loading for each joint throught the week, but also with our warm ups and accessories. The warm ups and accessories are planned 
                                    by a MyPowerFix physiotherapist. The warm ups include specific mobility and activation work for the upcoming session, to prepare your body 
                                    as well as possible. We also work on the typical weaker links we find in athletes, as well as skill work. The accessories include sport specific 
                                    movements, but we also work on the things that are left out in the sports. A healthy joint needs strength, stability and mobility in all movement 
                                    directions and in all ranges of motion. We make sure to provide a varied accessory program to complement the typical functional fitness-movements, 
                                    to make stronger and more stable joints, and to reduce the risk of injury</p>
                                <h6>PERIODIZATION</h6>
                                <p>To be able to maximize performance and progress, we work in 4 main training cycles throughout the year. Currently the 
                                    CrossFit Open & Quarterfinals are the main goals during the season, and we build towards them throughout the year. Even though every training cycle 
                                    has its own focus points, we do train everything all year around, and always aim to stay in good shape!</p>
                                <h6>INDIVIDUALIZATION</h6> 
                                    <p>We have wanted to create a program that works for all different levels of athletes. Always when needed, the workouts 
                                    and gymnastics progressions have 3 different levels (LEVEL 1: Elite / international level athlete, LEVEL 2: RX / national level athlete, LEVEL 3: 
                                    Intermediate/scaled level athlete). This allows you to always get the correct stimulus of each workout, and you don't have to think yourself about how 
                                    to scale the workout. Each day also includes an optional piece for those who have more time and resources for training. Some days we also offer different 
                                    options for the workouts, depending on what you want to work on specifically. Feel free to ask us any questions if you want more information about which 
                                    level to choose, and remember we also offer the semipersonalized option for those who want to work on some specific parts of the training with their own 
                                    coach, while still following our main track.</p>
