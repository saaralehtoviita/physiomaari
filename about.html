                    <p class="text-center mt-3">I'm Maari, a 31-year old Finnish girl living currently in Valencia, Spain. 
                        Sports have played a huge role in my life ever since I was young, 
                        and after taking some time off after high school I finally decided sports and helping other people enjoy an active and healthy lifestyle is what I wanted to do for a living. 
                        So I started studying the Bachelor's Degree in Sports at Arcada University of Applied Sciences. 
                        During my studies, I stumbled upon physiotherapy through friends and my own injuries, which lead me to continue my studies with the physiotherapy degree. 
                        Since then, I have also continued my education with a Master's Degree in Sports Physiotherapy at la universidad CEU Cardenal Herrera. 
                        I feel like the combination of these two degrees have given me a very good understanding not only about sports performance, 
                        but also of what health is, how we can use sports to promote health, and then again about injuries, rehabilitation, injury prevention and human movement. </p>
                        
                    <p class="text-center">I've done many sports in my life. Football (soccer) was my main sport growing up, and even though I never managed to get really good, 
                        it taught me a lot about training and conditioning. Besides soccer, I played most sports in both my middle school and high school teams, 
                        and have always been quite competitive. But it wasn't until I found CrossFit in 2015 that I really fell in love with one sport and training. 
                        I was addicted from the very first day, and here we are now 9 years later, still in love. CrossFit has also taught me a lot about training, 
                        movement, health, mental toughness and the importance of having a good community to support you. I utilize many things from the CrossFit ideology in my work as a 
                        physiotherapist and coach. I strongly believe in aiming to be able to do functional movements that transfer into daily life, no matter if you're 80 years old and 
                        recovering from a hip replacement-surgery, or if you're 20 years old and suffer from back pain, or 50 years old and simply want to workout for your health. 
                        I'm also really passionate about how to improve performance in this sport, and of course, how to prevent and rehabilitate injuries.</p>
                                            
                        <p class="text-center"><strong>My goal is simple:</strong> To help other people reach their goal.  No matter if your goal is to improve your performance in sports, 
                        to feel better and be healthy, to rehabilitate from injury or pain, or to prevent injuries in your sports or daily life, 
                        I'm here for you and will turn every stone necessary to be able to help you reach your goal. </p>

                        we'll see if we can find a solution to whatever problem you may have!</p>
